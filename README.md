Is this tedious? Yes! Do I want to do this? No! *but* given we will being dealing with like a billion commits (and a lot of merge conflicts) it is best to have some practice in place.
Like you don't have to do this for like "fix spelling" But DEFINITELY  for any notable change/feature/rework.
SO DO IT!
